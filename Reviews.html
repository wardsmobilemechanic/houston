Due to the circumstances surrounding the hurricane I was not able to find a mechanic to even look at my car without leaving it at their shop for days. Well Eric Ward came out to my job on Thursday 9/7 and once we got the part had it fixed that Monday 9/11. I am very happy with his prices and the convenience of having him come to my car to fix the problem.  Thank you again Eric!"

He arrived early, not just on time.  <BR/>\n<BR/>\nHe used the parts I had previously purchased - a rear master cylinder with linkage and a front master cylinder kit.  He permitted me to watch and ask questions while he worked.  After he finished the work, he patiently adjusted the cradle for the front master cylinder and front brake lever several times for my hands, grip and feel.  Between adjustments, he requested that I take a ride to determine if it felt right since that is extremely important.  I truly appreciated his patience and consideration.<BR/>\n<BR/>\nI have a front tire I am ordering for him to change now that I found someone I can trust.  (I tried a local dealership but I felt they were attempting to scam me.  I have been looking for someone with something different to offer - and Eric does - quality with reasonableness!)  <BR/>\n<BR/>\nI will definitely recommend him to my friends.<BR/>\n<BR/>\nSteve"

No matter where I was, or what happened to my car he was there. I had a problem when the fan to my Monte Carlo wouldn't turn on. He fixed it, and I didn't go broke because of it. What I find amazing about Eric is that he always knows exactly what's wrong, and how much it will cost to fix it. I can call him and tell him the weird noises my car is making, and he knows what it probably is. He is an expert mechanic.<br><br>2015<br>John H.<br>Great service and response time!

After calling several folks plus my AAA, no response. One trailer repair guy came by but said it could be tomorrow before he could get to it. My Mako is on the side of the road. I went to an auto parts store to ask for help, the sales person gave me Eric's number. He came out within 20 minutes, explained the issues and had me back on the road in 1.5 hours. I was in the water by 10:00 AM. Thank you guys.&nbsp;<br><br>2014<br>Private<br>*Told me what time to expect him and he came exactly at that time.&nbsp;<br><br>2014<br>Private<br>My AC Compressor was broken and needed to be replaced but I didn’t have much money to get such an expensive service done. So Eric removed the pulley to the AC Compressor and replaced it with a Bypass Pulley and new belt so I could at least continue to drive my car until I’m ready to get everything taken care of. While working he noticed a PCV vacuum hose needed to be replaced so he took care of that for me right on the spot. Eric provided all the parts and I was charged $274 for everything (Labor, Parts, and Tax) which I think was a fantastic deal! My car runs smooth and sounds brand new!<br><br>2014<br>Private<br>*Worked fast! It took 2 hours to finish the job.<br><br>2014<br>Private<br>*If you use a debit card to pay you’ll be charged 3% but Eric said if that’s a problem he can drive you up to an ATM.<br><br>2014<br>Jeanette R.<br>*Professional, Knowledgeable, Friendly and willing to work with you!

They are upfront on the pricing and the price doesnt increase last second. They really helped me get out of bind, since im looking for a job and didnt jave transportation. Thank you guys and I will not being using another mechanic when I need one.<br><br>2014<br>Art G.<br>i own a 1997 Honda CBR 1100XX Blackbird. It's moved with me to three different states and had been sitting around for a while. Eric picked up my bike in his trailer and did great work on it. He added an after market exhaust system, made some changes to the light fixtures, jetted the cards and a variety of other things to improve performance and overall left my bike in great shape. He did awesome work and I definitely intended to call him if i ever have the need for any more work on my bike. He kept me informed and stayed within my budget. He picked-up and delivered my bike between Seabrook and Humble. He's good people and knows what he's doing . I am very leery about who i trust my bike to and Eric did not disappoint. Thanks Eric - i appreciate your help. Art.<br><br>2013<br>trevor.james.963<br>He did great work on my s10 and Eric came right to me when I broke down in laport and fixed my elcamino, he is cheep and very Dependable and knows what he is doing.<br><br>2013<br>sirryan1<br>Eric was very prompt with his service and knew exactly how to fix my prob...on top of all that he was very affordable and polite. Ill never use another as long as he is available.<br><br>2013<br>cala.pope<br>they are very dependable with reasonable rates cheaper then a shop, and same day service did not make me pay a tow bill and saved me the week it would have spent in the shop. I recommend them to everyone I know and I hope you will do the same they keep to the original price and do not nickel and dime anyone.<br><br>2013<br>mary.perry.1610<br>The man knew what he was doing, and did a good job doing it. Fast, efficient, convenient &amp; reasonable. He came to my house to fix my a/c, now I wish I lived in my car! Very Satisfied.<br><br>2013<br>txphillylady<br>I have used him for several years and have come to find that there is nothing that he can't fix, from my commercial vehicles, to my personal vehicles and my toys… he keeps my business and myself going. Very dependable and he will also tell you the condition on other parts of your vehicles as well. Use Wards mobile mechanic. You won't regret it!<br><br>2013<br>Keep our K.<br>He had my a/c blowing 42 degrees, it only cost me $150 which was about $50 less than what another shop said it would be. And it only took about an hour!<br><br>2013<br>E.J.<br>Worked on my scooter. Communicated via email to set up appointment. They were friendly, knowledgeable &amp; quick. Were able to answer all the questions I had. And to add to the convenience, I could pay with my credit card. Would definitely use Ward's again. Not sure how rates compete because not everyone will work on a generic scooter. So yeah it might be a bit pricier...but since they're coming to you I expect that. Overall I'm definitely happy with my service.<br><br>2013<br>Kendal J.<br>Awesome service. Very fair prices. Would definitely use again!!! Prompt and professional..... He was able to come fix the water pump the same day I called him. Awesome experience!!! Will definitely use again! Very nice and professional. Quickly fixed my car and very fair price!!! Highly recommend!!!!!! Same day service too!!!<br><br>2013<br>Mary W.<br>Ward's mobile mechanic had been my mechanic for several years. You cannot beat his prices or the personal service that he supplies to each of his customers, whether they are commercial or personal, or the toys that we love so much in this hot weather. He repairs all of these items for me. I could never go anywhere else! I recommend this company to anyone I know and I'm recommending it to you as well!
